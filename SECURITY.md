Here's a template for a security policy that you can use in your GitHub repository by creating a `SECURITY.md` file:

# Security Policy

## Introduction

This security policy outlines how to report security vulnerabilities in our project and how we handle them. It is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of our codebase.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in our project, please follow these steps to report it:

1. **Do not open an issue**: Instead, contact us directly via support@gemcity.xyz.
2. **Provide detailed information**: Include as much detail as possible about the vulnerability, such as steps to reproduce it and any relevant code snippets.
3. **Use secure communication**: If possible, use encrypted communication methods to protect sensitive information.

## Supported Versions

We support security updates for the following versions of our project:
- All versions

## Response Process

Upon receiving a vulnerability report, we will:
- **Acknowledge receipt**: Confirm that we have received your report within [24 hours].
- **Investigate**: Assess the vulnerability and determine its severity.
- **Fix and deploy**: Develop and deploy a patch or fix as soon as possible.
- **Notify**: Inform you when the fix is available and provide details about the patch.

## Disclosure

After a fix is deployed, we will publicly disclose the vulnerability, including details about the issue and the fix, unless doing so would compromise security.
