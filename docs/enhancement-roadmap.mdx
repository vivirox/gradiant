## Notes and Considerations

### Current Priorities
1. Complete error handling and logging setup
2. Implement security headers
3. Configure monitoring and analytics
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline

### Technical Requirements
- Node.js v22.12.0 compatibility
- ES modules support
- TypeScript strict mode
- React 18 features

### Best Practices
- Follow ES module syntax
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Configure proper logging
- Implement security best practices

## Lessons Learned

### Build Configuration
- Use @tailwindcss/postcss for Tailwind CSS 4.x
- Configure PostCSS with ES module syntax
- Use explicit plugin imports
- Clean up null values with .filter(Boolean)

### Deployment
- Configure proper caching headers
- Set up SPA routing in vercel.json
- Document environment variables
- Implement proper error handling

## Updates and Maintenance
