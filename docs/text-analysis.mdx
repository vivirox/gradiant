# Text Analysis System Documentation

## Overview

The Text Analysis System is a core component of Gradiant that provides advanced natural language processing capabilities for therapy sessions. It combines multiple ML models and rule-based systems to analyze text content while maintaining HIPAA compliance.

## Components

### 1. Emotion Model
- Uses RoBERTa-based model fine-tuned on emotion detection
- Provides primary and secondary emotions with intensity scores
- Normalizes emotions to a standard set for consistency

### 2. Therapy Technique Model
- Zero-shot classification for therapy technique identification
- Supports common techniques like CBT, DBT, mindfulness
- Provides confidence scores for detected techniques

### 3. Crisis Detection Model
- Specialized model for identifying crisis situations
- Five-level severity classification
- Real-time trigger detection and immediate action flags

### 4. Semantic Analysis
- Rule-based system for extracting:
  - Key phrases and themes
  - Relationship context
  - Temporal information
  - Setting detection

### 5. HIPAA Compliance Checker
- Pattern-based PHI detection
- Identifies sensitive information categories
- Flags content requiring redaction

## Enhancements

#### Emotion Model
- **New Emotion Categories:** Added `shame`, `guilt`, `envy`, `pride`, and `relief` to the emotion detection capabilities.

#### Therapy Technique Model
- **Expanded Techniques:** Recognizes additional therapy techniques including:
  - Narrative Therapy
  - Acceptance Commitment Therapy
  - Emotionally Focused Therapy
  - Interpersonal Therapy
  - Play Therapy

#### Crisis Detection Model
- **Nuanced Categories:** Enhanced crisis detection with:
  - Severe Anxiety
  - Depression
  - Psychosis

## Usage

```typescript
import { TextAnalysisService } from '../services/TextAnalysisService';
import { SecurityAuditService } from '../services/SecurityAuditService';

// Initialize services
const securityAudit = new SecurityAuditService();
const textAnalysis = new TextAnalysisService(securityAudit);
await textAnalysis.initialize();

// Analyze text
const result = await textAnalysis.analyzeText(
  'I feel much better after our CBT session today.',
  'user123'
);

// Access analysis results
console.log(result.emotions); // Emotional state
console.log(result.therapyTechniques); // Detected techniques
console.log(result.crisisIndicators); // Crisis assessment
console.log(result.semanticAnalysis); // Context and themes
console.log(result.hipaaCompliance); // PHI detection
```

## Security and Compliance

The system is designed with security and HIPAA compliance in mind:

1. All operations are logged through SecurityAuditService
2. PHI detection prevents accidental data exposure
3. Crisis detection triggers immediate safety protocols
4. Data is processed with appropriate encryption

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite includes:
- Unit tests for each model
- Integration tests for the TextAnalysisService
- HIPAA compliance validation tests
- Crisis detection accuracy tests
- EmotionModel tests now cover unknown labels, empty inputs, and multiple emotions.
- TextAnalysisService tests include scenarios for handling no emotions, multiple techniques, and crisis detection.

Run tests using:
```bash
npm run test
```

## Future Enhancements

1. Multi-modal Analysis
   - Audio emotion detection
   - Video sentiment analysis
   - Non-verbal cue recognition

2. Advanced Features
   - Therapy progress tracking
   - Outcome prediction
   - Treatment recommendation

3. Performance Optimization
   - Model quantization
   - Batch processing
   - Caching strategies

## Dependencies

- @xenova/transformers: ^2.15.0
- TypeScript
- Jest (for testing)

## Contributing

When contributing to the text analysis system:

1. Follow TypeScript best practices
2. Maintain HIPAA compliance
3. Add appropriate tests
4. Update documentation
5. Consider performance implications

## Monitoring and Maintenance

The system includes:
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking
- Usage analytics
- Model version control

Regular maintenance tasks:
1. Update ML models
2. Review security logs
3. Validate HIPAA compliance
4. Optimize performance
