### Global Requirements

```json
{
  "jest": {
    "coverageThreshold": {
      "global": {
        "statements": 90,
        "branches": 85,
        "functions": 90,
        "lines": 90
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Critical Paths

The following areas require 100% coverage:

- Authentication flows
- Data encryption/decryption
- Payment processing
- HIPAA compliance features
- Security middleware
- Error handling
- Data validation

## Coverage Reports

### HTML Report

Generate and view HTML coverage report:

```bash
# Generate report
npm run test:coverage

# Open report in browser
npm run test:coverage:open
```

Example report structure:
```
coverage/
├── lcov-report/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── auth/
│   │   ├── api/
│   │   └── services/
│   └── assets/
└── lcov.info
```

### Coverage Badges

We use shields.io for coverage badges:

```markdown
![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-94%25-brightgreen.svg)
![Statements](https://img.shields.io/badge/statements-95%25-brightgreen.svg)
![Branches](https://img.shields.io/badge/branches-85%25-yellow.svg)
![Functions](https://img.shields.io/badge/functions-92%25-brightgreen.svg)
```

## Coverage Monitoring

### CI/CD Integration

```yaml
name: Coverage

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  coverage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
        
      - name: Run tests with coverage
        run: npm run test:coverage
        
      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v2
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
          files: ./coverage/lcov.info
          fail_ci_if_error: true
```

### Local Monitoring

1. Pre-commit hook:
```bash
#!/bin/sh
npm run test:coverage:check
```

2. VS Code extension:
```json
{
  "coverage-gutters.showLineCoverage": true,
  "coverage-gutters.showRulerCoverage": true,
  "coverage-gutters.highlightdark": "rgba(45, 121, 10, 0.2)"
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring**
   - Check coverage reports daily
   - Address coverage gaps promptly
   - Track coverage trends

2. **Coverage Quality**
   - Don't just hit lines
   - Test edge cases
   - Verify actual behavior

3. **Maintenance**
   - Update thresholds as needed
   - Remove dead code
   - Keep reports clean
