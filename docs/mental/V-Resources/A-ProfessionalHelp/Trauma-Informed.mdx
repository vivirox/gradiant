Healing from Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD) and addiction requires a supportive and understanding environment, which is why it's essential to find a therapist who specializes in trauma-informed care. However, navigating the world of mental health professionals can be overwhelming, especially for those struggling with trauma and addiction.

**What is Trauma-Informed Care?**

Trauma-informed care refers to an approach that acknowledges the impact of trauma on individuals' lives and provides a safe, supportive, and non-judgmental environment for healing. This type of care recognizes that everyone has experienced some form of trauma, whether it's physical, emotional, or psychological.
