Additionally, consider the following online resources:

* ***The International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation (ISSTD)***: A professional organization offering educational resources and certification programs.
* ***The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)***: A government agency providing evidence-based treatment guidelines and training programs.

Remember to respect confidentiality and privacy in all online interactions, just as you would with in-person therapy.
