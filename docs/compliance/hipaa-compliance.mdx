# HIPAA Compliance Documentation

## Overview

TherapyTrain implements a comprehensive HIPAA compliance system that ensures the security, privacy, and integrity of Protected Health Information (PHI). This document outlines the core components, workflows, and procedures implemented to maintain HIPAA compliance.

## Core Components

### 1. Violation Detection System

The violation detection system continuously monitors for potential HIPAA violations through real-time event processing. It covers:

- **Unauthorized Access Detection**
  - Real-time monitoring of access attempts
  - Pattern recognition for suspicious activities
  - Automatic account locking for repeated violations

- **PHI Exposure Monitoring**
  - Encryption status verification
  - Access level monitoring
  - Data transmission security checks

- **Encryption Compliance**
  - Real-time encryption verification
  - Key rotation monitoring
  - Encryption failure detection

### 2. Real-time Monitoring Service

The HIPAA Monitoring Service provides continuous surveillance of system activities:

- **Event Types Monitored**
  - PHI access logs
  - Authentication attempts
  - Encryption operations
  - Data retention compliance
  - System integrity checks

- **Monitoring Thresholds**
  ```typescript
  unauthorized_access: {
    medium: 2 attempts
    high: 5 attempts
    critical: 10 attempts
  }
  authentication_failure: {
    medium: 3 failures
    high: 7 failures
    critical: 15 failures
  }
  phi_exposure: {
    medium: 1 instance
    high: 3 instances
    critical: 5 instances
  }
  ```

### 3. Alert System

The alert system ensures immediate notification of potential violations:

- **Alert Types**
  - HIPAA violations
  - Security breaches
  - System errors

- **Severity Levels**
  - Low: Informational, no immediate action required
  - Medium: Requires attention within 24 hours
  - High: Requires immediate attention
  - Critical: Requires immediate action and incident response

- **Notification Channels**
  - Email notifications for high and critical alerts
  - SMS notifications for critical alerts
  - Dashboard notifications for all alerts

### 4. Remediation Workflows

Automated and manual procedures for addressing violations:

#### Unauthorized Access Workflow
1. Automatic account locking
2. Security team notification
3. Access log review
4. Security assessment
5. Documentation of incident

#### PHI Exposure Workflow
1. Immediate data securing
2. Exposure scope assessment
3. Breach notification protocol
4. Incident documentation
5. Security protocol updates

#### Encryption Failure Workflow
1. Affected data securing
2. Encryption system verification
3. Key rotation if necessary
4. System integrity check
5. Security audit

## Compliance Procedures

### 1. Audit Trail Maintenance

- **Event Logging**
  - All PHI access is logged
  - Authentication attempts are recorded
  - System configuration changes are tracked
  - Encryption operations are documented

- **Log Retention**
  - Logs are retained for 6 years
  - Encrypted storage of audit logs
  - Regular integrity verification
  - Automated archival process

### 2. Data Retention

- **Retention Periods**
  - PHI: 6 years minimum
  - Audit logs: 6 years
  - Security incidents: 6 years
  - System backups: 30 days

- **Deletion Procedures**
  - Secure deletion protocols
  - Verification of deletion
  - Documentation of deletion
  - Backup cleanup

### 3. Incident Response

1. **Detection Phase**
   - Automated violation detection
   - Real-time monitoring alerts
   - User-reported incidents
   - System-generated warnings

2. **Assessment Phase**
   - Incident severity evaluation
   - Impact assessment
   - Scope determination
   - Risk analysis

3. **Containment Phase**
   - Account locking if necessary
   - Data access restriction
   - System isolation if required
   - Temporary security measures

4. **Remediation Phase**
   - Automated remediation steps
   - Manual intervention procedures
   - Security updates
   - System hardening

5. **Documentation Phase**
   - Incident details recording
   - Action log maintenance
   - Resolution documentation
   - Compliance reporting

### 4. Security Measures
