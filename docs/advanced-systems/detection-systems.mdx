# Advanced Detection Systems in Therapy

## Overview

Advanced detection systems in therapy combine multiple modalities of analysis to provide comprehensive insights into client behavior, emotional states, and potential crisis indicators. This document outlines the key components and implementation approaches for building robust detection systems.

## Multimodal Analysis Components

### 1. Text Analysis (NLP)
- Sentiment analysis for emotional patterns
- Topic modeling for conversation themes
- Entity recognition for key concerns
- Temporal analysis for pattern changes

### 2. Voice Analysis
- Frequency change detection
- Stress indicators in speech
- Emotional state analysis
- Speech pattern anomalies

### 3. Behavioral Markers
- Response timing patterns
- Consistency analysis
- Engagement metrics
- Interaction patterns

### 4. Contextual Analysis
- Situation assessment
- Historical context integration
- Environmental factors
- Support network analysis

## Implementation Architecture

```typescript
interface DetectionSystem {
  textAnalysis: {
    sentiment: number;
    topics: string[];
    entities: Entity[];
    temporalPatterns: Pattern[];
  };
  
  voiceAnalysis: {
    frequencyChanges: FrequencyData[];
    stressIndicators: StressMarker[];
    emotionalState: EmotionalState;
  };
  
  behavioralAnalysis: {
    responsePatterns: Pattern[];
    consistencyScore: number;
    engagementMetrics: Metrics;
  };
  
  contextualAnalysis: {
    situationAssessment: Assessment;
    historicalContext: HistoricalData;
    environmentalFactors: Factor[];
  };
}

interface Pattern {
  type: string;
  confidence: number;
  timeframe: TimeRange;
  indicators: string[];
}

interface Assessment {
  riskLevel: "low" | "medium" | "high" | "critical";
  confidenceScore: number;
  factors: Factor[];
  recommendations: string[];
}
```
