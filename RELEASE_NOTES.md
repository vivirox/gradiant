## Breaking Changes

This is the initial release, so there are no breaking changes to document. However, if you are migrating from JIFF, please note:

1. Protocol naming and configuration differences
2. Share format changes
3. Different preprocessing requirements
4. Updated security parameters

## Migration Guide

### Migrating from JIFF

1. Update Dependencies:
   ```json
   {
     "dependencies": {
       "@gradiant/mp-spdz-bindings": "^1.0.0"
     }
   }
   ```

2. Update Imports:
   ```typescript
   // Old JIFF import
   import * as jiff from 'jiff';
   
   // New MP-SPDZ import
   import { JIFFAdapter, JIFFAdapterConfig } from '@gradiant/mp-spdz-bindings';
   ```

3. Update Configuration:
   ```typescript
   // Old JIFF config
   const jiffInstance = new jiff.JIFFClient(...);
   
   // New MP-SPDZ config
   const config: JIFFAdapterConfig = {
     partyId: 0,
     numParties: 3,
     threshold: 1,
     protocol: MPCProtocol.SEMI2K
   };
   const adapter = new JIFFAdapter(config);
   ```

4. Update Operations:
   ```typescript
   // Old JIFF operations
   const share = jiffInstance.share(value);
   const result = share.smult(otherShare);
   
   // New MP-SPDZ operations
   const share = await adapter.share(value);
   const result = await adapter.multiply(share, otherShare);
   ```

## Installation

1. Install the package:
   ```bash
   npm install @gradiant/mp-spdz-bindings
   ```

2. Install system dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install automake build-essential clang cmake git \
     libboost-dev libgmp-dev libntl-dev libsodium-dev libssl-dev \
     libtool python3
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   export MP_SPDZ_BINARY_DIR=/path/to/MP-SPDZ
   export MP_SPDZ_PREPROCESSING_DIR=/path/to/preprocessing/data
   ```

## Performance Considerations

1. Protocol Selection:
   - Use SEMI2K for best performance in trusted environments
   - Use SPDZ2K for efficient integer arithmetic
   - Use MASCOT when malicious security is required

2. Batch Processing:
   - Group similar operations together
   - Use array operations when possible
   - Leverage preprocessing data efficiently

3. Memory Management:
   - Clean up shares when no longer needed
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Use appropriate protocol parameters

## Security Recommendations

1. Protocol Security:
   - Use MASCOT for untrusted environments
   - Enable MAC verification
   - Configure appropriate security parameters

2. Network Security:
   - Use TLS 1.3
   - Configure proper firewall rules
   - Monitor for unauthorized access

3. Key Management:
   - Rotate keys regularly
   - Secure key storage
   - Proper key distribution

## Known Issues

- Large integer operations may require additional memory
- Preprocessing phase can be time-consuming
- Network latency can impact performance

## Future Plans

1. Short-term:
   - Additional protocol optimizations
   - Enhanced monitoring features
   - Extended protocol support

2. Long-term:
   - New protocol implementations
   - Advanced security features
   - Performance improvements
