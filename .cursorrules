# Instructions

During you interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again.

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

# Tools

Note all the tools are in python. So in the case you need to do batch processing, you can always consult the python files and write your own script.

## Screenshot Verification

The screenshot verification workflow allows you to capture screenshots of web pages and verify their appearance using LLMs. The following tools are available:

1. Screenshot Capture:

```bash
venv/bin/python tools/screenshot_utils.py URL [--output OUTPUT] [--width WIDTH] [--height HEIGHT]
```

2. LLM Verification with Images:

```bash
venv/bin/python tools/llm_api.py --prompt "Your verification question" --provider {openai|anthropic} --image path/to/screenshot.png
```

Example workflow:

```python
from screenshot_utils import take_screenshot_sync
from llm_api import query_llm

# Take a screenshot
screenshot_path = take_screenshot_sync('https://example.com', 'screenshot.png')

# Verify with LLM
response = query_llm(
    "What is the background color and title of this webpage?",
    provider="openai",  # or "anthropic"
    image_path=screenshot_path
)
print(response)
```

## LLM

You always have an LLM at your side to help you with the task. For simple tasks, you could invoke the LLM by running the following command:

```
venv/bin/python ./tools/llm_api.py --prompt "What is the capital of France?" --provider "anthropic"
```

The LLM API supports multiple providers:

- OpenAI (default, model: gpt-4o)
- Azure OpenAI (model: configured via AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT in .env file, defaults to gpt-4o-ms)
- DeepSeek (model: deepseek-chat)
- Anthropic (model: claude-3-sonnet-20240229)
- Gemini (model: gemini-pro)
- Local LLM (model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-AWQ)

But usually it's a better idea to check the content of the file and use the APIs in the `tools/llm_api.py` file to invoke the LLM if needed.

## Web browser

You could use the `tools/web_scraper.py` file to scrape the web.

```
venv/bin/python ./tools/web_scraper.py --max-concurrent 3 URL1 URL2 URL3
```

This will output the content of the web pages.

## Search engine

You could use the `tools/search_engine.py` file to search the web.

```
venv/bin/python ./tools/search_engine.py "your search keywords"
```

This will output the search results in the following format:

```
URL: https://example.com
Title: This is the title of the search result
Snippet: This is a snippet of the search result
```

If needed, you can further use the `web_scraper.py` file to scrape the web page content.

# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

- You have a python venv in ./venv. Use it.
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.

## Cursor learned

- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities

# Scratchpad

## Current Task: Systematic TypeScript Refactoring (March 2024)

### Root Cause Analysis:
1. Architecture Issues:
   - Duplicate type definitions across frontend and backend
   - Inconsistent module organization
   - Circular dependencies in type definitions
   - Mixed concerns in type definitions

2. Type Definition Issues:
   - Redundant type exports
   - Inconsistent naming conventions
   - Missing or incorrect type declarations
   - Overly complex type hierarchies

### Systematic Solution:

1. Core Type System Architecture:
   [ ] Create a shared types directory structure:
   ```
   src/
   ├── types/
   │   ├── core/           # Core type definitions
   │   │   ├── auth.ts
   │   │   ├── user.ts
   │   │   └── common.ts
   │   ├── api/            # API-related types
   │   │   ├── requests.ts
   │   │   └── responses.ts
   │   ├── models/         # Data model types
   │   │   ├── session.ts
   │   │   ├── message.ts
   │   │   └── profile.ts
   │   ├── services/       # Service-related types
   │   │   ├── analytics.ts
   │   │   ├── audit.ts
   │   │   └── encryption.ts
   │   ├── ui/            # UI component types
   │   │   ├── props.ts
   │   │   └── events.ts
   │   └── utils/         # Utility types
   │       ├── helpers.ts
   │       └── guards.ts
   ```

2. Type Definition Standards:
   [ ] Implement consistent type definition patterns:
   - Use interfaces for extendable types
   - Use type aliases for unions and primitives
   - Use enums for fixed sets of values
   - Use generics for reusable type patterns

3. Module Organization:
   [ ] Establish clear module boundaries:
   - Core types (shared between frontend/backend)
   - Frontend-specific types
   - Backend-specific types
   - Service-specific types
   - UI component types

4. Type Export Strategy:
   [ ] Create a systematic export strategy:
   - Barrel exports for related types
   - No circular dependencies
   - Clear type hierarchies
   - Consistent naming conventions

5. Documentation and Validation:
   [ ] Add comprehensive type documentation:
   - TSDoc comments for all types
   - Usage examples
   - Type constraints and validations
   - Migration guides for breaking changes

### Implementation Plan:

1. Setup Phase:
   [ ] Create new type directory structure
   [ ] Setup tsconfig paths
   [ ] Create type definition templates
   [ ] Setup type checking tools

2. Migration Phase:
   [ ] Move core types to shared location

## Current Task: Fix TypeScript Errors (March 2024)

### Error Analysis:
1. Module Resolution Issues (Most Critical):
   - Missing module declarations for core modules:
     - @/database.types
     - @/common
     - @/user
     - @/auth
     - @/chat
     - @/metrics
     - @/session
     - @/hipaa
     - @/security

2. Type Definition Issues:
   - Duplicate type declarations:
     - Database (3 occurrences)
     - ClientProfile (2 occurrences)
   - Incorrect type imports:
     - Database import from @supabase/supabase-js
     - SupabaseClientOptions type
     - RealtimeClientOptions type

3. Unused Import Issues:
   - Unused imports in:
     - src/types/common.ts
     - src/types/security.ts
     - src/types/services.ts
     - src/utils/auth.ts
     - src/components/ui/*

4. Event Handler Type Issues:
   - Unknown type errors in event handlers:
     - src/pages/Auth.tsx
     - src/pages/Chat.tsx
     - src/utils/eventUtils.ts

### Action Plan:
1. Module Resolution:
   [ ] Create missing module declaration files
   [ ] Update tsconfig.json paths
   [ ] Fix import paths
   [ ] Add proper type exports

2. Type Definitions:
   [ ] Consolidate duplicate types
   [ ] Fix incorrect type imports
   [ ] Update type declarations
   [ ] Fix type conflicts

3. Import Cleanup:
   [ ] Remove unused imports
   [ ] Fix circular dependencies
   [ ] Update import statements
   [ ] Add missing type imports

4. Event Handlers:
   [ ] Add proper type declarations
   [ ] Fix unknown type assertions
   [ ] Update event handler signatures
   [ ] Add type guards

### Progress:
[X] Initial error analysis
[X] Created systematic plan
[ ] Fixed module resolution issues
[ ] Fixed type definition issues
[ ] Fixed import issues
[ ] Fixed event handler issues

### Next Steps:
1. First, let's check the tsconfig.json to ensure proper module resolution setup:
   ```typescript
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "paths": {
         "@/*": ["./src/*"],
         "@/types/*": ["./src/types/*"],
         "@/components/*": ["./src/components/*"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. Then create the missing module declaration files:
   ```typescript
   // src/types/database.types.ts
   export interface Database {
     // Add database schema types
   }

   // src/types/common.ts
   export interface Metadata {
     // Add metadata types
   }

   // And so on for other missing modules...
   ```

### Notes:
- Many errors stem from missing module declarations
- Need to ensure consistent type exports across the application
- Should consider creating a central types directory for better organization
- Need to handle circular dependencies carefully
- Consider using barrel exports for related types

### Lessons Learned:
- Always create proper module declarations
- Use consistent type naming across the application
- Keep type definitions organized in proper modules
- Clean up unused imports regularly
- Use proper type guards for unknown types
- Handle circular dependencies carefully
