 added a few things and reorganized some. Things that will become integrated into Therapy Train, will now be under the folder 'integrate', and they'll be submodules now.

The next thing on our roadmap is the chat. I'm wanting to mold a lot of Vercel's AI Chatbot (its chatbot under 'integrate' folder) into TherapyTrain's chat. Mainly the backend routing and functions,but some of the UI too.

We'll still be integrating all of that with our Supabase for both the database and backend and auth functions.

And for all of that, we'll be using Zero Knowledge to keep everything perfect. I added another submodule to 'integrate' as well, 'nexus'. It's a very well done Zero Knowledge system. I added it for reference, if it can help us build better, more efficiently, and quicker too.

I also added 'edge-runtime', 'style-guide', 'styled-jsx', and 'swr' -- all for reference points that can help build on Vercel a safer, more efficient, and optimized overall project. Incorporate all of this (not completely, just bits and pieces here and there over time) into our integration-roadmap, and then we can proceed on the chat build directly after.

I'll help update the integration roadmap to incorporate these new elements and submodules. First, let me analyze the current roadmap and then make the necessary updates.
Based on your input, I'll update the integration roadmap to incorporate the new submodules and their features. I'll create an edit that reorganizes and adds new sections focusing on the Vercel AI Chatbot integration, Zero Knowledge implementation from Nexus, and the additional reference modules.
I've updated the integration roadmap to focus on the new priorities and submodules. Key changes include:
Chat System Integration
Added Vercel AI Chat integration section with focus on backend routing and UI components
Included Edge Runtime integration for performance optimization
Added streaming responses and rate limiting considerations
Zero Knowledge Implementation
Added Nexus integration section for secure message handling
Included end-to-end encryption and key management
Added security monitoring and audit system
3. Advanced Features
Added SWR integration for efficient data fetching and caching
Included styling patterns from style-guide and styled-jsx
Added responsive design and UX considerations
Performance Optimizations
Added Edge Runtime features for caching and request handling
Included SWR patterns for data fetching and caching
Added styling best practices section
The timeline has been updated to prioritize:
Zero Knowledge infrastructure setup
Chat system integration
Edge runtime implementation
Advanced features and optimizations
Would you like me to make any adjustments to the updated roadmap? For example, we could add more specific details about the Vercel AI Chatbot integration or expand on the Zero Knowledge implementation from Nexus.
We can expand later on, it looks good for now

Great! Since we have a clear roadmap now, and you mentioned the chat system is our next priority, would you like to begin with the Vercel AI Chat integration? We can start with either:
Core Chat Architecture
Setting up the backend routing system
Adapting API routes for Supabase
Implementing streaming responses
Zero Knowledge Implementation
Studying Nexus ZK patterns
Setting up secure message handling
Implementing end-to-end encryption
Or if you prefer, we could start with a different aspect of the chat integration. Let me know which part you'd like to tackle first, and I'll help you implement it.
Both of those can be started on now

I'll help you start with both the Core Chat Architecture and Zero Knowledge implementation in parallel, as they need to be integrated together for a secure chat system.
Let's begin by examining both the Vercel AI Chat and Nexus codebases to understand their architectures and plan our integration. I'll first look at the chat architecture.
Let's examine both the Vercel AI chatbot and Nexus codebases to understand their key components:
Let's start by examining the key components we'll need to integrate. First, let's look at the Vercel AI Chat's routing and API structure:
Based on the directory structures, here's how we can start integrating both systems:
Initial Setup
Create a new app/api/chat directory for our secure chat endpoints
Set up a lib/zk directory for our Zero Knowledge implementation
Create a components/chat directory for our secure chat UI components
Let me create these directories and initial files:
Now, let's create the initial files for our secure chat implementation. I'll create:
A secure chat route handler
The ZK encryption utilities
The chat UI components
