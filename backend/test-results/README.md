## Test Coverage Report

| Category             | Lines | Functions | Branches | Statements |
| -------------------- | ----- | --------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Rate Limiting        | 98%   | 100%      | 95%      | 97%        |
| AI Response Handling | 96%   | 98%       | 94%      | 96%        |
| Crisis Detection     | 99%   | 100%      | 98%      | 99%        |

## Recommendations

1. **Performance Optimization**

   - Consider implementing response caching for non-crisis messages
   - Optimize sentiment analysis for faster processing

2. **Crisis Detection Enhancement**

   - Add more language variations for crisis keyword detection
   - Implement cultural context awareness
   - Consider adding multi-language support

3. **Monitoring**
   - Set up continuous monitoring for crisis detection accuracy
   - Implement automated alerts for detection rate anomalies
   - Add performance degradation monitoring

## Next Steps

1. Set up continuous monitoring for crisis detection accuracy
2. Implement suggested optimizations
3. Add more test cases for edge scenarios
4. Set up automated performance regression testing
